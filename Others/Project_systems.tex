\begin{itemize}
 % \item \textbf{AI Messenger Bot} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Messenger-Bot}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Messenger-Bot} | \textbf{Node.js, Facebook Messenger Platform}\\
 % - Built a messenger bot to query professor's or universities in USA.\\
 % - Professor's or university ratings/comments/quality are obtained through RateMyProfessor API.\\
 % - Facebook messenger platform used enables bots to converse with users through Facebook apps and pages.\\
 % - Custom intent messages to be replied was developed in Node.js.

 % \item \textbf{Slack Bot} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Slack-Bot}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Slack-Bot }| \textbf{Node.js, Wit.ai, Google Api}\\
 % - Developed a resilient, micro-serviced based natural language aware Bot for Slack app with Node.js.\\
 % - NLP module, wit.ai used to process input context to reply corresponding services.\\
 % - Requesting a time of any particular location the bot uses google geocoding and timezone API. 

 % \item \textbf{Sat Encoding Solver} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/SAT-Encoding}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/SAT-Encoding} | \textbf{Python , AI}\\
 % - Implemented a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for any given CNF sentences.\\
 % - Implemented PL and DPLL resolution algorithms to find the resolution for the problem.\\
 % - Implemented WalkSAT algorithm to find ramdom solution for given SAT problem.

 %  \item \textbf{Spatial Databases} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Spatial-Database}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Spatial-Database} | \textbf{Spatial DB, Postgres, Google Earth}\\
 % - Developed a convex hull using co-ordinates around Los Angeles from spatial queires.\\
 % - Spatial queries written to show intersection and overlaps of given areas.\\
 % - All representations of areas are by convex polygons on google earth using kml files. \\
 % - Drew a deltoid curve on google earth centered around USC campus.

  \item \textbf{Weenix kernel} | \textbf{C, Weenix kernel, Qemu simulator}\\
 - Designed and developed features such as processes, threads, context switching and synchronization primitives\\
 - Worked on Unix based Weenix Operating System.\\
 - Developed a Virtual File System (VFS) to provide common interface between kernel and other file systems. \\
 - Developed Virtual Memory(VM) providing an abstraction of address space for user processes.

 \item \textbf{Traffic Simulator} | \textbf{C, POSIX Pthreads}\\
 - Simulated a traffic shaper which transmits packets asynchronously controlled by a token bucket filter.\\
 - POSIX Pthread Multi-threading used within a single process for parallel executions.\\
 - All statistics inter-arrival time, service time, average number of packets in a queue are displayed.\\
 - The standard deviation for time spent for a packet along with packet/token drop probability are shown.\\
 - The program executes for both input parameters and trace driven mode.
