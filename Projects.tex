\section{Relevant Projects}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Traffic Simulator} | \textbf{C}\\
In this project, I simulated a traffic shaper which transmits packets controlled by a token bucket filter using multi-threading within a single process.In this emulation, packet arriving at intervals are processed based on tokens required by them to be serviced by the server. All statistics of the packet such as inter-arrival time, service time, average number of packets in a queue, the standard deviation for time spent for a packet along with packet/token drop probability are shown for both input parameters and trace driven mode. 

 \item \textbf{Weenix Kernel} | \textbf{C}\\
In this project, I worked on building blocks of Weenix operating system such as processes, threads, context switching and synchronization primitives. I also have implemented a Virtual File System (VFS) which provides a common interface between operating system kernel and various file systems.

 \item \textbf{Connect+} | \textbf{HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL}\\
This is a social networking site used to connect among college peers and friends. The application provides features such personal messaging a friend connected to you, post on their wall, status updates and create groups of people with common interests and pages with relevant interests.

 \item \textbf{PyEdit} | \textbf {Python, PyGtk} \\
This is a word processor in python language using the PyGTK module which includes all features of a text editor along with syntax highlighting of several languages.

 \item \textbf{Zmq Sockets} | \textbf { Python, Zmq}\\
 This is an application to demonstrate messaging patterns (push-pull, request-reply), where a client from a city subscribes to get weather updates from a server with one of these patterns. Zmq socket library was used to implement these functionalities.
