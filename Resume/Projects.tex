\section{Relevant Projects}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{AI Messenger Bot} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Messenger-Bot}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Messenger-Bot} | \textbf{Node.js, Facebook Messenger Platform}\\
 - Built a messenger bot to learn about professors' or universities in US.\\
 - Professors' or university ratings/comments/quality are obtained through the RateMyProfessor API.\\
 - Facebook messenger platform used enables bots to converse with users through apps and pages.\\
 - Custom intent messages replied to user was developed in Node.js.

 \item \textbf{Slack Bot} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Slack-Bot}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Slack-Bot }| \textbf{Node.js, Wit.ai, Google API}\\
 - Developed a resilient, micro-service based natural language aware bot for Slack app.\\
 - NLP API, wit.ai was invoked with updated query parameters based on the application.\\
 - Implemented geocoding and time calculations and also monitoring services.

 \item \textbf{SAT Encoding Solver} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/SAT-Encoding}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/SAT-Encoding} | \textbf{Python , AI}\\
 - Implemented a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for any given CNF sentences.\\
 - Utilised PL and DPLL resolution algorithms to find solutions for the problem.\\
 - Leveraged WalkSAT algorithm to find random solution for given SAT problem.

 %  \item \textbf{Spatial Databases} | \href{https://github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Spatial-Database}{github.com/Shreyas-vgr/Spatial-Database} | \textbf{Spatial DB, Postgres, Google Earth}\\
 % - Developed a convex hull using co-ordinates around Los Angeles from spatial queries.\\
 % - Wrote spatial queries to show intersection and overlaps of given areas.\\
 % - All representations of areas are by convex polygons on google earth using kml files. \\
 % - Drew a deltoid curve on google earth centered around USC campus.

  \item \textbf{Weenix kernel} | \textbf{C, Weenix kernel, Qemu simulator}\\
 - Worked on unix based weenix operating system.\\
 - Designed and developed features such as processes, threads, context switching and synchronization primitives.\\
 - Developed a Virtual File System (VFS) to provide common interface between kernel and other file systems. \\
 - Implemented Virtual Memory(VM) providing an abstraction of address space for user processes.

 % \item \textbf{Traffic Simulator} | \textbf{C, POSIX Pthreads}\\
 % - Simulated a traffic shaper which transmits packets asynchronously controlled by a token bucket filter.\\
 % - POSIX Pthread Multi-threading used within a single process for parallel executions.\\
 % - All statistics inter-arrival time, service time, average number of packets in a queue are displayed.\\
 % - The standard deviation for time spent for a packet along with packet/token drop probability are shown.\\
 % - The program executes for both input parameters and trace driven mode.
